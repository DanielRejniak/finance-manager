# What Is This ? 🤔

Handy finance calculator that allows one to calculate the `income`, `spending's` and passible savings in a period of current month. Income and spending's are inputted into a `finance-sheet` that provides convenient and once off method of configuration.

There is also an additional feature that will print a summary your spending's to keep them on track. See sample response below.
